How does one navigate information? Why is it so often the case that we see reference to a research article that is grossly misinterpreted and how can we better understand how to consume science?
## A Little History

The year is 1975 and a paper was just published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine that is investigating the relationship of tumors and tumor growth. The paper hypothesized that because tumors develop in two stages, avascular and vascular (no blood feeding the tumor and blood feeding the tumor) that it could be prevented from reaching the vascular phase of growth through inhibition of tumor-angiogenesis-factor (TAF). The avascular stage lasts between 3-5 days, during which it produces TAF in order to stimulate vascularization. The logic goes that in the body cartilage is an avascular tissue, therefore, it must have some ability to prevent vascularization. This study successfully demonstrated that if cartilage (highly refined cartilage from the distal segment of scalar bones of 70 rabbits) was injected to the site of the tumor it would decrease and in some cases prevent the growth of blood vessels to the tumor site. Well done

Research continued to progress within this subject until an issue arose. Killing 70 rabbits or calfs for cartilage is a bit excessive. Researchers Anne Lee and Robert Langer stated “The single factor most limiting to further study of this substance (cartilage) is present only in small quantities in mammalian species. It occurred to us that sharks may be a potential source of this inhibitor because, unlike other mammals, sharks have an endoskeleton composed entirely of cartilage”. The paper goes on to describe the similarities and differences between shark cartilage and calf cartilage (the type of cartilage used to demonstrate decreased tumor angiogenesis thus far). Moreover, it demonstrates that shark cartilage also contains the same anti-angiogenesis effect as the calf cartilage. 

Fast forward to the year of 1992. Dr. William Lane whose interest in this research inspired him to write a book titled “Sharks Don’t Get Cancer”. In this book he goes on to profess that oral consumption of shark cartilage is a treatment for cancer and other diseases. In the following years of this book, millions of sharks are collected and killed for their fins, from which they are ground and converted into consumable cartilage pills.

## Understanding Science

It’s easy to see how problematic this way of thinking is. The original research articles are thought out approaches that applied the scientific method in order to find a conclusion about a hypothesis. They are tests that can be repeated to ensure validity of their statements. Moreover, they are methodically laid out in such a way that it is apparent how the researchers came to their conclusions.

This is an example of research being misrepresented. The line of logic is this. 

Cartilage prevents cancer, if I consume cartilage, I will cure or prevent my cancer.
However, if we were to apply a more vigorous line of logic to this same situation we might come to this statement. 

Both rabbit cartilage from scapular bones and Basking shark fins stored at -20 degrees celsius, and extracted for 41 days in a guanidine and ethanesulfonic acid solution were found to be suitable agents when directly placed in the corneas of rabbit eyes to decrease the vascularization of carcinoma and melanoma (the location of the implanted tumors).

Moreover, the issue with the original logic is that it neglected a large component of most any treatment. The delivery of the intervention to the site of the issue. It raises more questions than it answers. How does the cartilage make it through the stomach acid without being denatured? If it is denatured how will it affect the treatment? How much of the cartilage is absorbed in the GI? Does the amount absorbed match the original intervention amount? Once absorbed, how does the cartilage make it to the tumor site? If cartilage causes decreased angiogenesis, does this affect places in my body where I want angiogenesis to occur? Are there any side effects to this treatment? It is easy to come to the conclusion that had a few questions been asked, this book would have never sold.

## The Research Pyramid

![Pyramid](https://themedicalrinse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pyramid.png)

A good first step is understanding the scientific pyramid of information. We can see that the pyramid has several lays to select from at the bottom of which is anecdotal information. This would be where the book Sharks Don’t Get Cancer falls. This would also be friends on Facebook, family members at Thanksgiving, and articles like the one you are reading now would fall. There are stratifications within this layer as well, ranging from expert opinions at the top and uncle Fred’s conspiracy theories at the bottom. 

Case reports are an n=1. That is to say, the population of interest for something being observed is only 1. While close to the bottom of the pyramid, case reports are still very valuable pieces of information. They often go on to inform the layers above. Evidence based research can only take you so far in clinical decision making, especially considering extremely rare conditions.

Case studies give a glimpse of what worked or didn’t work with these conditions and help to inform the plan of care for patients. Case Series are when you begin to collect enough case reports of close enough similarity that it’s possible to start drawing conclusions from the papers. Sticking with the same example, let’s say that we now have collected 15 case reports of patients over 10 years with rare condition x. It’s possible to start looking at the outcomes for all those patients and to draw conclusions about how they should be treated in the future. 

Pilot studies or preliminary studies are performed in order to test the validity of a hypothesis. Here, there is statistics performed to determine the pool size of the study, meaning, the number of data points needed to validate or invalidate an idea. Preliminary studies are also used as a way of testing an experimental protocol (is the test actually testing what it is supposed to or is there some issue with the protocol that makes it impractical such that others will not be able to repeat the test). 

Randomized control trials (RCT) are the expansion of pilot studies into more robust studies. This includes expanding the population size or number of data points collected, or improving upon the protocol of the experiment. As you can guess from the name the trial itself is randomized. In an ideal situation, both the person who is participating in the experiment and the person performing the experiment are blinded to what is being tested. There are several ways in which to do this and most studies will outline the measures that were taken in order to accomplish this (this is something to be aware of when evaluating the quality of an article).

Systematic reviews are the compiling and synthesizing of information from RCTs to test whether or not the issue of interest is valid or invalid. Just as the name implies, these are the most systematic of all the research articles you may come across. They give a birds eye view on topics and make it possible to determine the validity of a hypothesis rather quickly. They can however, be imperfect. For example getting to this level of research for a very specific topic may be a problem. Systematic reviews are VERY specific answers to a very specific question. 

Meta analysis is performed during systematic reviews. These are statistical inferences made on the RCTs. Not all systematic reviews have a meta analysis as a lot of the time it is not appropriate to do so. A good thing to be aware of when looking at systematic reviews is if they performed a meta analysis when they should not have. It’s possible to do one when there is any systematic review, even ones with only 1 article in them. But the point is to be able to draw an accurate picture across many different articles. As Ian Malcom would say

## Other Approaches

Ok so I’ve laid out the different levels of research and gave a little explanation as to what they are and how they can be used.how does one apply this? It’s simply good to know where to look for information. Knowing where information falls on the pyramid is important for understanding the quality of information being consumed. Those that already have a good grasp of the pyramid may already be thinking of examples of how only using this could lead to poor quality of information. That is the right mind set! 

Generally speaking, this is just one approach to looking at information. Another might be assessing the articles themselves. Going back to the shark cartilage, a useful took someone could apply would be a PICO question. PICO stands for Population Intervention Control and Outcome. The book sharks don’t get cancer is jumping from what is known as a foundational science article to an human intervention. You will often read on headlines titles like “New cure for Cancer” or “Medicine stops cancer cells from forming”. While this research is extremely important, often it is still in the foundation stages, meaning that it had not left the petri dish. Applying a PICO question to your searches will help you identify if what it is you are curious about applies to you. For example, if I wanted to know whether or not an intervention for cancer would work for me I would do a search with the following: P = 28 year old male (at the time of this article) I = Shark cartilage C= standard cancer treatments i.e radiation and chemo O = elimination of cancer.

Now this search is extremely specific. Moreover, it is much more likely to give me the quality of information that I need. If you’re not consuming information in this fashion you might come to the wrong conclusions. For example, as a 28 year old male I might want to know the best way to gain muscle mass. After performing a search I found an article that demonstrates a 15% increase of lean muscle mass on male patients ages 45-55 with testosterone therapy. After reading this I may come to the conclusion that I need to start supplementing with testosterone in order to achieve my goal of gaining muscle mass. It’s important to note that this is the wrong population. Males begin going through andropause in their late 20s and continue to decline into their middle age 45-55. This example is likely too simplistic, but it serves to demonstrate that without knowing the specifics of a question you may be finding answers to a different one. The book Sharks don’t get cancer resulted in millions of sharks being killed each year for their fins. Even worse, people neglected to get life saving cancer treatment and instead trusted that their cure was in a small pill full of cartilage. There are a multitude of ways in which to break down and digest information. There are also a lot of good quality resources that help to do it for you. They are of course no substitute for your own research.

## Closing Thoughts

There are SO MANY sources of information out there that it sometimes feels impossible to vet all of it. The case above highlights how vulnerable populations can be taken advantage of in order to push unproven information and, sadly, places greater value on selling a product than human life. Here are several resources that can be used to help navigate the wild ocean of information available to us today.
